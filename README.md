# *Gritty-ify* 

*This mini-project serves as an excellent exercise to master `user interactions` on a `dynamic and responsive website`. It offers several fun features, such as image rotation, masking and unmasking effects, and a "greet" system that allows users to submit personalized messages. The primary goal is to develop the following skills:*

- *Advanced `DOM manipulation` to create interactive features.*
- *Use of `ES6` for more concise and `modern JavaScript` code.*
- *Understanding and application of `events` as well as `event listeners` to interact with users.*
- *Management of visual aspects with `CSS` to improve the user experience.*

*If you'd like to tinker with this practice project yourself, fork the repo or download the files.*
